# Html based GUIs

> Fulib supports some simple Html based Guis.
> The basic type is a UI element.
> A UI that represents a complete page just needs an id.

There is a UI with id loginPage.

> A UI that represents a line within that page needs an id, a description and a parent.

There is a UI with id title and with description "login page" and with parent loginPage.

> To generate the html file gui01.html and a screen shot guiO1.html.png (for the loginPage) write.

![loginPage](gui01.html.png)

> A simple description like "login page" becomes a label, i.e. a text centered in a line.
> To create a input field use a description like "input userName prompt text".

There is a UI with id inputField and with description "input userName name?" and with parent loginPage.

> "userName" is the key that will allow to read and write the text within that input field.

> Finally there is a description like "button ok gui04.html" that creates a button
> with text "ok" and on click loads "gui04.html".

> A page may have parameters which are key value pairs. If the key refers to an input field,
> we write the value into that field.
